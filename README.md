# BJ-WPS-PIN-WIFIHK

## Description
This is a simple Wi-Fi hacking tool based on WPS PIN, written in Python, designed to run on a Nethunter mobile terminal. It is intended for educational purposes and to help users learn about Wi-Fi security.

## Requirements
- Python 3 installed on your Nethunter mobile terminal.
- ROOT
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BijayaShyangtanTMG/BJ-WPS-PIN-WIFIHK
    ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
    ```bash
    cd BJ-WPS-PIN-WIFIHK
    ```
3. Run the installer script to set up and install the requirements:
    ```bash
    bash installer.sh
    ```

## Usage
To run the tool, use the following command:
```bash
python3 BJ-wps.py -i wlan0 -K



Important Notes
This Python script can only hack some WPS PIN-enabled networks. Nowadays, most networks use WPA/WPA2 security, so this tool cannot hack all networks.
This tool is intended for learning purposes and should be used responsibly. It is not very effective against all types of network security.
Please do not blame the developer if the tool does not work as expected. This tool is based on Python and has its limitations.
Disclaimer
This tool is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool to access networks without permission is illegal and unethical. The developer is not responsible for any misuse of this tool.


# Usage
```
 oneshot.py <arguments>
 Required arguments:
     -i, --interface=<wlan0>  : Name of the interface to use

 Optional arguments:
     -b, --bssid=<mac>        : BSSID of the target AP
     -p, --pin=<wps pin>      : Use the specified pin (arbitrary string or 4/8 digit pin)
     -K, --pixie-dust         : Run Pixie Dust attack
     -B, --bruteforce         : Run online bruteforce attack
     --push-button-connect    : Run WPS push button connection

 Advanced arguments:
     -d, --delay=<n>          : Set the delay between pin attempts [0]
     -w, --write              : Write AP credentials to the file on success
     -F, --pixie-force        : Run Pixiewps with --force option (bruteforce full range)
     -X, --show-pixie-cmd     : Alway print Pixiewps command
     --vuln-list=<filename>   : Use custom file with vulnerable devices list ['vulnwsc.txt']
     --iface-down             : Down network interface when the work is finished
     -l, --loop               : Run in a loop
     -r, --reverse-scan       : Reverse order of networks in the list of networks. Useful on small displays
     --mtk-wifi               : Activate MediaTek Wi-Fi interface driver on startup and deactivate it on exit
                                (for internal Wi-Fi adapters implemented in MediaTek SoCs). Turn off Wi-Fi in the system settings before using this.
     -v, --verbose            : Verbose output
 ```

## Usage examples
Start Pixie Dust attack on a specified BSSID:
 ```
 sudo python3 oneshot.py -i wlan0 -b 00:90:4C:C1:AC:21 -K
 ```
Show avaliable networks and start Pixie Dust attack on a specified network:
 ```
 sudo python3 oneshot.py -i wlan0 -K
 ```
Launch online WPS bruteforce with the specified first half of the PIN:
 ```
 sudo python3 oneshot.py -i wlan0 -b 00:90:4C:C1:AC:21 -B -p 1234
 ```
 Start WPS push button connection:s
 ```
 sudo python3 oneshot.py -i wlan0 --pbc
 ```
## Troubleshooting
#### "RTNETLINK answers: Operation not possible due to RF-kill"
 Just run:
```sudo rfkill unblock wifi```
#### "Device or resource busy (-16)"
 Try disabling Wi-Fi in the system settings and kill the Network manager. Alternatively, you can try running OneShot with ```--iface-down``` argument.
#### The wlan0 interface disappears when Wi-Fi is disabled on Android devices with MediaTek SoC
 Try running OneShot with the `--mtk-wifi` flag to initialize Wi-Fi device driver.
